# Contributors

This is maybe the most important file of this project: it recognizes people who
are helping and are, directly or indirectly, baking this project success.

Those people spend their time, for free, to make this project better. As time is an
asset that never comes back, and these people choose to use their time in this
adventure, this file is a attempt to show them the respect they earned.
